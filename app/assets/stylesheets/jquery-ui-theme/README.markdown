jQuery UI theme
===============

This directory contains the jQuery UI theme in the subdirectory `theme` and
a script that integrates it to Rails' asset pipeline.

You can create a jQuery UI theme using jQuery UI's ThemeRoller
<http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/> as follows:

1. Delete the old theme directory
2. Create the theme and download it
3. Extract the generated zip file to a temporary directory
4. There is a theme directory under the directory `css`. Move it to this
   directory and rename it to `theme`.
